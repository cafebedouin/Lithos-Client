 * The one place the protocol's contracts are compiled, cached per network for the life of the JVM.
 *
 * Not only an optimisation: the sigma compiler mutates `_sourceContext` on shared AST nodes, so
 * compiling the same script twice in one run can throw. It is also what keeps compilation off the
 * critical path of mining.
 *
 * Keyed by network rather than by context, because synchronization builds its constants before any
 * context exists. Both `Contract.fromErgoScript` overloads are one code path, so either caller gets
 * the same contracts.
 *
 * Also keyed by the deployment override's fingerprint (`lfsm.Deployment`), because the ids compiled in
 * come from it: a cache keyed by network alone would keep serving the trees of whichever deployment
 * was active first, and every box found under the new one would be skipped as foreign.
