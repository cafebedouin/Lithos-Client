/**
 * Advances the boxes its jobs maintain inside this miner's own block, with no key and no fee.
 *
 * Two halves, as in the storage-rent source. A timer asks each job what it maintains and keeps only
 * ids; the candidate path reads the boxes back, has each job build the due ones until the share is
 * spent, and answers through [[transactions.candidate.CandidatePreparation]]. The read-back is the
 * only check that matters: a box that does not come back is spent. The build closes over values it
 * is handed and reports back by message, so no actor field is read off the mailbox.
 *
 * Never extractive. Nothing here reads pending transactions, so nothing reorders or front-runs
 * anyone, and a job's transaction may only spend the boxes that job discovered.
 *
 * Holds outlive the actor in a [[UpkeepSource.Memory]], so a restart does not offer the node the
 * same transaction again. With `verifyWithNode`, each admitted successor goes through the node's
 * transaction check in the build `PrepareBlockTxs` starts, off the request path, and the node
 * evaluates it at the next block's height, the candidate's own. In observe mode a request is
 * answered empty at once and the build runs as a task no request waits for.
