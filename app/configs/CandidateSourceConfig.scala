 * What one transaction source may contribute to this miner's own block.

 * Each source is bounded on its own before the package is bounded as a whole, so a busy source
 * cannot crowd out a quieter one that matters more. A source that is off contributes no work at
 * all — it is never asked, so it costs no build and no node read.
 *
 * @param maxTxs   transactions this source may place in one block
 * @param maxBytes serialized bytes it may claim, counting unconfirmed ancestors it carries
 * @param maxCost  execution cost it may claim. An unconfirmed ancestor reports none, which is part
 *                 of why the package as a whole claims only a share of the block
