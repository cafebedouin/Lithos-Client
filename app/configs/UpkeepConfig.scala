/**
 * How this client looks for the boxes its upkeep jobs maintain, and which jobs it runs.
 *
 * Jobs are read generically from `jobs.<name>`, so registering a new job needs no config code: the
 * registry decides what a name means, and config only says whether it runs, which boxes it is told
 * about, and whatever keys of its own the job's factory reads from its block. A name that is not in
 * the registry is caught by validation, not here.
 *
 * @param scanIntervalMs gap between discovery passes. Discovery is background work and must never
 *                       be on the path a block is built on.
 * @param maxBoxesPerJob  box ids one job may hold between passes beyond its configured ones. A job
 *                        that finds more keeps the first this many in its own priority order, so
 *                        one busy protocol cannot grow the actor's memory or the build's node read
 *                        without bound. Validation also holds each configured list to this number
 *                        and to [[UpkeepConfig.MaxConfiguredBoxes]].
 * @param retryAfterScans discovery passes a box whose build was refused sits out before it is
 *                        offered again. A refusal may be the box's own doing or the moment's — a
 *                        node that could not be read — and the source cannot tell which, so it
 *                        retries after this many passes rather than never; a box refused again
 *                        sits out as many again.
 * @param jobs            each configured job by name. Absent is off.
 * @param mode            `candidate` offers what is built to the block; `observe` answers every
 *                        request empty at once and, in a task of its own, builds, sizes and puts
 *                        each successor through the node's transaction check, logging the verdict.
 *                        For an operator with no block yet, who has no other way to see upkeep do
 *                        anything real. Observe keeps no memory: a box candidate mode would set
 *                        aside is rebuilt and logged at every height; a height that arrives while
 *                        the previous task is still running is skipped, not queued. It runs only
 *                        while the stratum builds candidates with `blockTransactions = true`, with
 *                        this source enabled, `maxTxs` above 0, and at least one job enabled.
 * @param verifyWithNode  in candidate mode, put each admitted successor through the node's
 *                        transaction check before offering it, and leave out of that height any
 *                        the node refuses; this is not remembered, and the next height tries the
 *                        box again. A package the node rejects loses every inserted transaction
 *                        with it, so one bad successor would otherwise cost the block the work of
 *                        every source.
 * @param space           `fixed` holds the source to its configured share; `opportunistic` lets it
 *                        grow, block by block, into what the package share would leave empty after
 *                        the mempool's own demand. Fixed by default, because whether fee-less work
 *                        should take space at all beyond what the operator set is a policy choice.
 * @param opportunisticMaxTxs the most successors an opportunistic share admits however empty the
 *                        block, so a runaway job cannot fill one.
