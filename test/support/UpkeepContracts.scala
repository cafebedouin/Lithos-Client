 * The reference upkeep contract, compiled from `test/resources/upkeep/DueJob.ergo` for the specs
 * that hold the client's pinned tree to it. The client itself never compiles it: `HeartbeatJob`
 * carries the tree, and the source is kept with the tests as the record of what that tree is.
 *
 * `DueJob` takes no constants: a box under it is found by its tree alone, so the tree is the same
 * for every network and deployment.
